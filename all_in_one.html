<!--
A form button is used primarily to submit the form data to the server. There are two types of elements that can do this:

An <input type="submit" value="Send!"> element will create a submit button with the text of "Send!" on it.

A <button type="submit">Send!</button> element will do exactly the same thing.

The difference between these two elements is that because a <button type="submit"> element has a closing tag, you can put other elements inside it. Elements like spans, images or icons, for example. Whereas an <input type="submit"> button can only hold plain text as it's value.

Another type of form button attribute is the type="reset". This attribute can be applied to either an <input> or <button> element, and when clicked will reset the form to its original values when the page was first loaded.

<h1>Semantic Form Elements</h1>


<!-- HTML5 introduced new form elements that help organise content on the web page. One of them is <fieldset> which groups related elements by drawing a box around any elements nested inside it.

The <fieldset> element is usually followed by a <legend> element, which defines a title for the <fieldset> element. The legend content is displayed inside the top line of the fieldset border.

<!-- The img Element

We already talked about the <img> element back when we were first introducing you to attributes. But let's go back over some of the details now you are more familiar with HTML syntax.

The <img> element is a self-closing element, meaning it cannot have other content nested inside it, and it has no closing tag.

As you may remember from the attributes unit, the <img> element takes two important attributes: The src attribute, which takes the file path to the image file to be displayed. And the alt attribute for text to be displayed if the image file does not load, and to describe the image on screen readers for visually impaired users.

The <img> element can also take height and width attributes to control its size. Though it is worth bearing in mind, it is better practice to use CSS to control height and width properties, once you have learned how, of course.

Take a look at the runnable example below -->


 <img width="150" src="https://f87e1ce6-c6ea-4434-915c-4ef1bf4e8004.id.replitusercontent.com/daisys.png" alt="A close up photograph of daisys"/>

<!-- The picture Element

The <picture> element gives more flexibility to set image resources in your projects, as you can use it to set different images to be shown depending on the width of the browser viewport. By using the picture element, you can display different images to the user depending on the screen size they are viewing your webpage on. This is part of what is known as responsive design - changing how your website looks for mobile, tablet or desktop size screens.

The most common use of the <picture> element would be for art direction in responsive designs. Instead of having an image that is scaled up or down based on the width of the browser window, multiple images can be designed to fit nicely into the width of the screen.

The <picture> element holds two different elements: One or more <source> elements, and one <img> element.

When used with the <picture> element, the <source> element needs two important attributes: srcset, which defines the URL of the image to show. And media which accepts a media query.

Media queries are used in responsive design to control what can be seen on different screen sizes. A wide landscape photograph looks great on a laptop screen. However, the same size image on a phone screen would need the user to scroll sideways, and they would not be able to see the whole image all at once.

For a <source> element, the media attribute value follows this syntax: media="(max-width: 600px)" this means "apply this source image when the browser viewport has a width of 600 pixels or less". So, if your screen size were more than 600px wide, the image attached to this media query would not be shown. You will learn more about media queries in the CSS module.

The source element is a self-closing element; it does not need a closing tag.

The <img> element is required as the last child element of the <picture> element. The <img> element is used to provide backward compatibility for browsers that do not support the <picture> element, or if none of the <source> elements media queries are active. -->
<picture>
    <source media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset ="https://codeinstitute.s3.amazonaws.com/HTMLEssentials/jellyfish.png">
    <source media="(max-width: 900px)" srcset ="https://codeinstitute.s3.amazonaws.com/HTMLEssentials/sunflower.png">
    <img src="https://codeinstitute.s3.amazonaws.com/HTMLEssentials/art.png" alt="Assorted images">

</picture>

<h2>IFrames</h2>

 <!-- An <iframe> element embeds another web document within the current document. It displays a web page within a web page. It adds the content of the new page while keeping the content of the current document unchanged. Lots of websites have embedded Google maps or YouTube videos. Those are all examples of iframes. In fact, the live code editors that you have been using throughout this course are embedded using iframes.

An essential <iframe> attribute is the src attribute which is used to define the address of the web page that will be embedded into the current page. You can also use width and height attributes to set the dimensions of your iframe.

Some very old browsers do not support iframes. It is good practice to add a message to be displayed to users when the iframe will not load. This message goes between the opening and closing iframe tags like this:

<iframe src="https://www.google.com"><p>Your browser does not support iframes.</p></iframe> -->

<iframe src="https://bit.ly/2QVfkiy" height="200" width="100%"><p>Your browser does not support iframes.</p></iframe>

<iframe src="https://www.wikipedia.org/" height="600" width="450"><h1>Sorry, your browser doesn't support iframes!</h1></iframe>






<h2>The audio Element</h2>


<!-- The audio Element

The <audio> element is used to embed sound content into a web page. The source of the audio file is defined using the src attribute on the audio element.

The <audio> element can take several other attributes depending on the behaviour you want it to have. If the controls attribute is included the browser will give the user controls for audio playback, including volume and pause. The loop attribute will set the audio file to start over each time it is finished. And the muted attribute specifies if the audio file should be muted when the file is first loaded.

The autoplay attribute, when set, will automatically play the audio on page load. However, it is considered a bad user experience to autoplay audio or video that has sound on it. Some browsers - including Chrome - will block audio files from playing automatically until the user interacts with the page.

All of these attributes can be added to the audio element without a value being attached. for example:

<audio src="myAudio.mp3" controls muted loop>

Browsers don't all support the same file types for audio, so if you want to be sure your audio file will play on all of them you can provide multiple sources inside nested <source> elements, and the browser will use the first one that it finds compatible.

When nested inside an <audio> element, the <source> element takes two attributes: The src attribute, which defines the path to the audio file, and type, which defines the type of audio file. The value for the type attribute here is either audio/mpeg or audio/ogg.

You can read more about multiple audio sources in this documentation.

An <audio> element can also contain a <track> element. This element is used to reference timed text tracks (or time-based data), for example, to handle displaying subtitles automatically.

You can read more about the track element in this documentation.

As the <audio> element was introduced with HTML5, some browsers do not support it. So like the <iframe> element, you can leave a message between the <audio> opening and closing tags to be displayed to users of these browsers. You can put any html elements between your audio element tags; common choices are paragraph, anchor or heading elements for a text-based message. However, you could add an image, button or any other relevant content that makes sense to display to a user who can't access the audio element with their browser. -->

<audio src="https://codeinstitute.s3.amazonaws.com/HTMLEssentials/kid-laughing.mp3" loop controls>
        <span>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 audio:</span>
        <a href="https://codeinstitute.s3.amazonaws.com/HTMLEssentials/kid-laughing.mp3">Link to the audio</a>
        </audio>



<h2>The video Element</h2>

<!-- The video Element

<video src="myVideo.mp4" width="500" autoplay muted loop>

The <video> element is used to embed video content into a web page. The source of the video file is defined using the src attribute on the video element.

Like the audio element, the <video> element can take several other attributes, depending on the behaviour you want it to have:

If the controls attribute is included, the browser will give the user controls to the user for video playback, including volume and pause.

The loop attribute will set the video file to start over each time it is finished.

The muted attribute specifies if the video file should be muted when the file is first loaded.

When the autoplay attribute is set, the video will automatically play the on loading the page.

It is considered a bad user experience to autoplay a video that has sound on it. So if you use the autoplay property, it is also recommended to use the muted attribute, so the video is silent.

All of these attributes can be added to the video element without a value being attached (see example above).

Browsers don't all support the same file types for video, so if you want to be sure your video file will play on all of them you can provide multiple sources inside nested <source> elements, and the browser will use the first one that it finds compatible.

When nested inside a <video> element, the <source> element takes two attributes: The src attribute, which defines the path to the video file. And the type attribute, which defines the type of video file. The value for the type attribute here is either video/webm, video/mp4 or video/ogg. You can read more about multiple video sources in this documentation.

As the <video> element was introduced with HTML5, some browsers do not support it. So like the <audio> and <iframe> elements, you can leave a message between the <video> opening and closing tags to be displayed to users of these browsers.

The video element can also take the width and/or height attribute to control its size. -->

<video src="https://codeinstitute.s3.amazonaws.com/HTMLEssentials/sunset.mp4"
controls muted width="400" height="400">
    <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video.</p>
    <a href="https://codeinstitute.s3.amazonaws.com/HTMLEssentials/sunset.mp4">Link to the video.</a>
</video>


 <h2>Header</h2>

<!--The <header> element provides introductory content to a web page.

When nested inside the <body> element, it is the masthead for the web page, positioned near the top of the page and containing key information like the main heading <h1>, a tag line or introductory paragraph describing what the page is about. A <header> can also contain the navigation for the page.

The <header> element is also used inside an <article> element. More about the article element in a coming unit.-->

<header><h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1></header>


<h1>The nav Element</h1>

<!-- The <nav> element represents a location on a page that links to other pages or parts within the same page. Common examples of navigation sections are menus, tables of contents, and indexes.

A <nav> element is typically found near the top of every web page on a site because this is where the user expects it to be.

A web page can contain several <nav> elements. For example, one for site navigation and one for navigation of elements on the same page. Use of more than one nav element on the page is usually only necessary in complex websites with large amounts of information to structure.

Note though that not all groups of links on a page need to be in a nav element - Only sections that consist of major navigation blocks are appropriate for the <nav> element. For example, a <footer> may contain a list of links that don't need to be in a <nav> element.

 -->

 <nav>
   <a href="#">link</a>
 </nav>



 <nav>
     <a href="#section1">Section 1</a>
     <a href="#section2">Section 2</a>
     <a href="#section3">Section 3</a>
 </nav>

 <div id="section1">
     <h2>Section 1 content</h2>
     <p>The nav element represents a location on a page that links to other pages or to parts within a page. Common examples of navigation sections are menus, tables of contents, and indexes. A nav element is typically found near the top of every web page on a site, because this is where the user expects it to be.</p>
 </div>
 <div id="section2">
     <h2>Section 2 content</h2>
     <p>A web page can contain several nav elements. For example, one for site navigation and one for navigation of elements on the same page. Use of more than one nav element on the page is usually only necessary in complex ½websites with large amounts of information to structure.</p>
 </div>
 <div id="section3">
     <h2>Section 3 content</h2>
     <p>Note though that not all groups of links on a page need to be in a nav element - Only sections that consist of major navigation blocks are appropriate for the nav element. For example, a footer may contain a list of links that don't need to be in a nav element.</p>
 </div>








<h1>The footer Element</h1>

<!-- The <footer> element represents a footer for its nearest section of content. You are used to seeing footers at the bottom of most web pages, containing information about the author of the website, copyright data or links to related documents.

A <footer> can also be used inside an <article> element. We will talk in more detail about the article element in a coming unit. -->

<footer>
            <p>Contact us on Facebook!</p>
        </footer>

<h1>The section Element</h1>
<!-- The <section> element is used for a section of content when there isn't a more specific semantic element to represent it. Typically a <section> will include a heading element, but this is not mandatory.

We should not use the <section> element as a generic container for styling purposes only, in this case, we would use a <div>.

A rule of thumb is that a section should logically appear in the flow of a document. If you were to write an index for the content of your page, a section would represent one of the things in the index of content. For example, a section should be a 'section' of a <main>, <footer> or <header> etc, rather than just a division of space. -->
<section id="home"><h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1></section>
<section id="about"><h3>This is the best website in the universe!</h3></section>
<section id="contact"><p>Contact me or check out my GitHub</p></section>




<h1>The article Element</h1>



<!-- The <article> element is used for any self-contained sections within a web page, which can be independent of the other content. For example, a news article, blog or forum post.

A web page can have multiple <article> elements within it. An <article> can contain a <header> and <footer>, and one or more <section> elements.

Each article should be identified with a heading element <h1> - <h6> as a child of the article element.

When an <article> element is nested, the inner element represents an article related to the outer element. For example, the comments of a blog post can be inside an <article> element.

Take a look at the code in the runnable example below. Styling has been added to this example to show how the different elements are nested inside each other. The <section> elements are outlined in black, and the <article> elements in green. The <footer> elements have a grey background. -->



<article class="user_review">
	<p>Every bit as classy, clever and cockle-warming as it was 30 years ago.</p>
	<footer>
		<p>Posted by Maria</p>
	</footer>
</article>

<article class="user_review">
    <header><h1>The Article Element</h1></header>
<section><p>The article element is used for any self-contained sections within a web page, which can be independent of the other content. For example a news article, blog or forum post.</p></section>
</article>



<h1>The aside Element</h1>


<!-- The <aside> element is used for a portion of a document where its content is indirectly related to the document's main content. The <aside> element is often used as a sidebar or call-out box. It does not, however, have any associated styling. The semantic meaning is just content that is only tangentially related to the web page content. It might be content that enhances the main content but is not critical to its understanding. -->
<aside><p>HTML5 Semantic elements include the article, aside, header, nav, footer, and section elements.</p></aside>


<h1>The figure Element</h1>
<!-- Usually, the <figure> element contains an image-based component such as an illustration, diagram, graph, table or code snippet. The content of a figure element is referenced in the main flow of a document. However, it can be moved to another part of the document or an appendix, without causing the flow of information to be effected. Therefore the content of the figure should be self-contained.

You might be wondering, why would we use a <figure> element when we already know how to use <img>? What is the difference between these two elements? From a visual perspective, there is no difference. Still, on a semantic level, the difference between the figure and the image element is pretty simple: We use the image element to embed the image in an HTML document whereas we use the figure tag to semantically organize the content of an image in the HTML document. By placing an image file into a figure element, you are telling the browser and search engines that the content of the figure could be seen on its own, separate from the rest of the content of the page, and still make sense.

The figure element can contain an optional caption, using the <figcaption> element, which is also nested inside the <figure> element. You would use a <figure> where an image is not just decorative but is referred to in an article. -->


<figure>
  <img src="https://codeinstitute.s3.amazonaws.com/HTMLEssentials/jellyfish-sml.png" alt="Jellyfish">
  <figcaption>Happy Jellyfish</figcaption>
</figure>



<h1>The caption Element</h1>

<!-- The <caption> element is used to provide a caption for a <table>.

A <caption> element should be the first child of its parent element <table>.

If you have a <figure> containing only a <table>, then use the <figcaption> element instead of the <caption>. -->
<table>
        <caption>Available Courses</caption>
        <tr>
            <th>Subject</th><th></th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>HTML</td><td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>CSS</td><td></td>
        </tr>
    </table>



<h1>The details and summary Elements</h1>

<!--

The details and summary Elements

The <details> element creates a widget in which information is only visible when the widget is clicked on.

A summary or label for the widget is provided by using a <summary> element nested inside the <details> element.

The widget usually has a small triangle which points sideways or down to indicate its open or closed status.

A <details> element is closed by default, and might look something like the image below with only the text inside the <summary> element visible:

details element when closed
When a user clicks the details element, the rest of the content inside it is made visible, and the triangle indicator changes to point down, like this: -->

<details>
    <summary>Tech Requirements</summary>
    <p>A working laptop with internet connection is required.</p>
    <p>A second screen comes in handy for coding along with the videos.</p>
